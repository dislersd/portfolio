{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dylan. I am a full-stack developer from Seattle, Washington. Learning how to code started out as a hobby for me, but I quickly grew obsessed with building things that required both creativity and logic. I recently graduated from Lambda School, a technical skills academy, where I spent 40+ hours a week learning the latest web development trends and fundamental computer science skills to bring my projects to life. I'm currently a Section Lead at Lambda, guiding 20 Team Leads and 150+ students through the school's Full Stack Web curriculum while I continue writing code and building applications.\n\nCheck out some of the [projects](#projects) I've worked on! Or head back to the [top](#home) ðŸ‘†\n"}},"profile":{"title":"My Photo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/imcunjjeiixj/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/063ab799bbb558ac822559ed6a5a12c3/IMG_9401-2.jpg?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
